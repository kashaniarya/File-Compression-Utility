Brief Summary:
This program uses Huffman coding to compress and decompress files.
 A file is either compressed (with the -c option), uncompressed (with the -u option), 
 one of which is required, unless the -t option is specified. The input filename is required. 
 If the output filename is not specified, output is written to the standard output.
